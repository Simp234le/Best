          <h3>vending machine</h3>
          <p>
            This vending machine will be made out of cardboard, and Consists of
            2 Microbit sensors, the ultrasonic sensor. When you turn the handle
            a item will drop from the top, and a face from the microbit will
            light up.

            A ragdoll robot that can be flung around and interacted in multiple
            different ways, It will be made of cardboard, strings and paper.
            This consists of 3 Microbit sensors, the Ultrasonic sensor, the
            gesture sensor and the music box, When one the these components
            activate the microbit will light up.

          <h3>ragdoll</h3>
          <p>
            A Micro Bit arcade game, this arcade game is created using only a
            micro bit and some cardboard. The code consists of the code stroll
            and when button a or b is pressed the pixel will move up or down.

          <h3>veding machine</h3>
          <p>
            (This project will requires 2 laptops) Our project is the “vending
            machine” which is a miniature version of the real one, due to the
            lack of components we were limited to only our hands for it to work.
            The vending machine consists of only cardboard and the micro bit
            components, but for it to work we will need to have a code, the code
            we have came up with is via javascript;
          </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>step 1</h3>
            <p>
              We then turn the cardboard vertically then “using a boxcutter” to
              create a rectangular hole in the top center of the cardboard
              horizontally, which is the coin slot for the machine. After that
              we make an area to fit our Ultrasonic sensor in, by measuring the
              length and width of the component we effectively make a spot to
              slide the component in.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>step 2</h3>
            <p>
              Next we make a hole 4 cm down from the original hole and cut a
              rectangular hole matching the dimensions of the microbit, this is
              the area of which our 1st microbit is placed, fold the net into a
              rectangular prism and tape on all sides to secure the prism.
              Following that we create another net ⅓ taller in height and ½
              wider in width. Subsequently we make a hole measuring the same
              dimensions of the micro bit 2cm down from the top of the net,
              center vertically.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>step 3</h3>
            <p>
              Then we create a much bigger hole in the middle of the cardboard
              2cm down from the previous hole and 2 cm from both of the sides,
              make sure to also make the hole 7 cm from the bottom. Next we cut
              open a hole 2 cm down from the biggest hole, 2 cm from the sides
              and 1 cm from the bottom, this is the opening for the items in the
              vending machine. On the back, create a hole exactly in the center
              of the face and poke a stick through it, this is the hinge for the
              handle. Make a ledge 4 cm from the hole we had just made. This is
              the place where we put our 2nd microbit component. Slide a
              cardboard piece 4 cm down the stick, anchor it to the stick.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>step 4</h3>
            <p>
              Make a cardboard piece matching the top part of the net, make a
              hole in the center of the piece. To ensure the items fall on top
              of the stick piece. line the hole above the stick making sure it
              is 1 cm above. Fold the net into place creating a rectangular
              prism. Place the micro bit components in the areas stated in this
              instruction and connect them from the microbit to a battery pack
              or a computer and sticky tape them on Lastly, make the items you
              want to drop from the microbit make sure to make them smaller
              than the hole above the stick. Download the code via “Make code”
              on the bottom left of your screen after you finished with code #1
              This code is for the coin slot. Take your 2nd laptop and Download
              Via the same website, for Code #2 This code is for the stick
              handle.
